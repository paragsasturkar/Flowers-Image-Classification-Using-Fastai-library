I have built an image claaification model to classify 3 types of flowers (roses/hibiscus/lotus) using fastai library.
Model validation accuracy achieved was ~97% (Resnet34) (I believe this accuracy could be improved a bit by adjusting the learning rate and number of epochs used while training the model)
